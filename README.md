#### In the Frontend hackathon held at StackRoute, a team of 7 IBMers were created, and specifically, our team was asked to make a replica of "https://www.creative-tim.com/" website using all the technologies we know.
#### So, we divided our website in 7 webpages and started working accordingly.
#### The contribution done by each member is given below:
###### Jaspal (Scrum Master) : The Landing page (index.html) and footer
###### Anjali Singh : e-commerce webpage (ecommerce.html) and footer
###### Nilanjan : tools webpage (tools.html)
###### Vinay : bundles webpage (bundles.html)
###### Sunil : blog webpage (blog.html)
###### Akhila : presentation webpage (presentation.html)
###### Sahithi : contact webpage (contact.html) and header
